#Problem Formulation
The task is to find two different *special* numbers inside an integer-valued vector $\vec{n}$, which is provided to the quantum computer by a user. The positions i and j of these numbers are to be returned to the user as a state of the quantum computer with the wave function psi = (|bin(i)> + |bin(j)>) / sqrt(2). Here bin(a) stands for the binary representetion of the number a.




The answer to this problem 

have to be encoded into the 
encoded into the wave function

solution to the problem is expected 
to be given by the wave function 
the wave function of the form 

It is assumed that 
(i) the length of the vector is 2^N_l
and 
(ii) all vector components are different and can take values in the range from 0 to 2^N_v
Two numbers are called *special* if their binary representation is either or 010101... or 101010... 

The solution to the problem is expected 
to be given by the wave function 
the wave function of the form (|a> + |b>) / sqrt(2)

The positions of the *special* numbers 
translated into the binary representation
is the solution of the task and 

##Example
Let us consider the vector
n = [1,2,7,5]
that is related to N_l = 2 and N_v = 3

In the binary representation this vector is given by
n_{\rm bin} = [001, 010, 111, 101]
The special numbers are on the 1 and 3 positions

The solution to the problem is the wave function of the form (1 + 3) / sqrt(2) or in the binary representation (01 + 11) / sqrt(2)
